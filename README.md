# The most difficult and favorite part 
The most difficult part when I start to test my game to check if all scenario test is work or not, so I need to track my code from the beginning to the end, In the same time it is my favorite part when I solve one problem I am excited to have another problem and solve it also, I learned a lot of things when I tested all the scenario and how to solve the problems faster.
